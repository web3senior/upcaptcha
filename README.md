CAPTCHAs have some drawbacks and limitations, such as:

<ul>
    <li>
    They **waste** human time and attention. According to some estimates, humanity wastes about 500 years per day on CAPTCHAs1. It takes an average of 32 seconds for a user to complete a CAPTCHA challenge1, which can be frustrating and distracting, especially if the CAPTCHA is hard to read or irrelevant to the task at hand.
    </li>
        <li>
They are not accessible or inclusive. CAPTCHAs assume that users have the physical and cognitive abilities to solve them, which may not be the case for people with visual, auditory, or motor impairments, or people who speak different languages or have low literacy levels. Some CAPTCHAs offer alternatives, such as audio or math tests, but they are not always available or effective.
    </li>
        <li>
They are not foolproof or secure. CAPTCHAs can be bypassed or broken by various methods, such as using optical character recognition (OCR) software, hiring human solvers, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the CAPTCHA system. Some researchers and spammers have been able to defeat CAPTCHAs with high accuracy and speed2.
    </li>
</ul>

Therefore, CAPTCHAs can be seen as a waste of human time and a source of annoyance and exclusion for many users. They are not a perfect solution for verifying human identity or preventing online abuse.
